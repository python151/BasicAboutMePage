I am Matthew Miller I am a B-team left tackle on the HMS football team. I am well versed in Python, Javascript (vanilla node, vanilla frontend JS, and JQuery), SQL (mySQL, and SQLite), Java, C, C++ and various other technologies. I also am familiar with designing and building computer systems (and some basic Elictrical Stuff). My text editor of choice is VS Code (even for C++... I know I'm weird).
